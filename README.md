Hey! I'm Marilyn Haber, a driven software developer with a passion for technology.

ðŸ’» At **Logisoft**, where I work as a .NET developer, I focus on creating solutions that enhance efficiency and innovation in the freight management industry.

ðŸš€ With a growth mindset, I continuously seek opportunities to expand my skills and and make meaningful contributions..

ðŸŒŸ Currently, I'm involved as a _**Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador**_, where I engage with the tech community to support learning and growth.

ðŸ’« Iâ€™m inspired by Rob Siltanenâ€™s quote: **_"People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."_**
