Hey! I'm Marilyn Haber, a driven software developer with a passion for technology.

ðŸ’» I kickstarted my career as a .NET developer at Logisoft, while still an undergraduate computer science student.

ðŸš¢ Currently, I am crafting impactful solutions to enhance innovation and efficiency in the freight management industry.

ðŸš€ I have a growth mindset and always seek new opportunities to expand my skills and make a difference in the world!

âœ¨As the lead of a Google Developers Student Club, my mission is to empower students and help them embark on their own tech journeys!

One of the quotes that I love ðŸ’«

"People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do" - Rob Siltanen
