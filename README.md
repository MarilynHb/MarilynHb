# Hi there! I'm Marilyn 👋

## About Me
I'm a dedicated software developer with a passion for tech! I work as a .NET developer at _**Moneygate Solutions Ltd**_, where I focus on creating impactful solutions in the fintech industry. 
With a growth mindset, I continuously seek opportunities to expand my skills and and make meaningful contributions.🚀 Currently, I'm also a _**WomenTechmaker Ambassador**_, supporting and inspiring others in their tech journeys.

I’m inspired by Rob Siltanen’s quote: **_"People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."_** 🌠
