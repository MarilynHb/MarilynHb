Hey! I'm Marilyn Haber, a driven software developer with a passion for technology.

💻 I kickstarted my career as a .NET developer at Logisoft, while still an undergraduate computer science student.

🚢 Currently, I am crafting impactful solutions to enhance innovation and efficiency in the freight management industry.

🚀 I have a growth mindset and always seek new opportunities to expand my skills and make a difference in the world!

✨As the lead of a Google Developers Student Club, my mission is to empower students and help them embark on their own tech journeys!

One of the quotes that I love 💫

"People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do" - Rob Siltanen
